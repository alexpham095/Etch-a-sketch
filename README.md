The projects aims to mimic an Etch-a-sketch using html, css, and javascript.
The main focus is javascript Document Object Model manipulation. I also use
the chrome developer tools in order to test for any errors. With this project,
I reinforced what I learned about DOM and have grabbed a better sense of what 
javascript can do.
